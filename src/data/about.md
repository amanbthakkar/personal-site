# Intro

I am a Computer Science grad student at the University of California, Irvine. As of right now, I am actively looking for full-time roles beginning January 2024. If you're a recruiter (!!), please check out my resume and projects and reach out to me @ [thakkaa1@uci.edu](mailto:thakkaa1@uci.edu) or [amanbthakkar@gmail.com](mailto:amanbthakkar@gmail.com).

# Hobbies and Interests

I am an avid football (soccer) fan and absolutely love both playing and watching it. I've also played [Fantasy Premier League](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/) religiously every year for the past 12 years (minus the last two - but I'll be back soon). I support [Chelsea FC](https://www.chelseafc.com/en) and it is my dream to work at the club one day.

During COVID when I was "Working From Home", I got extremely interested in finance, the markets, and cryptocurrencies. I watched [Andrew Lo's MIT lectures](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-401-finance-theory-i-fall-2008/pages/video-lectures-and-slides/) on the basics of finance and then proceeded to complete a course on [Financial Engineering](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/financialengineering) where I learnt more about derivatives and their pricing. And of course, Cryptocurrencies + Markets = Decentralized Finance! I took part in the first ever [DeFi MOOC](https://defi-learning.org/f22) organized by UC Berkeley and received an [Honorary Tier NFT as a certificate](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6965659384886538240/) for my efforts. I thought of pursuing a Masters in Financial Engineering as well, but ultimately decided to continue Computer Science at UCI.

# Blog Posts

During the above time period I wrote a few blog posts on mathematical models related to pricing of cryptocurrencies, and am particularly fond of one related to the Power Law Oscillator. An [entire page](https://www.amanthakkar.com/btc-indicator) on this site is dedicated to it. I wrote some other posts too, which you can find [here](https://medium.com/@amanbthakkar).

This website was actually first borne out of a desire to not need to run the [Python script for the oscillator](https://github.com/amanbthakkar/crypto_finance/blob/master/Power%20Oscillator.ipynb) daily on my local machine.

I wanted to host it somewhere so I could just look it up daily. I thought I'd share it with everyone, but then I thought I'd want to see how I could keep track of how many people actually visited my website. I could have used Google Analytics but I didn't want to.

So I decided to create a full-stack website and keep track of the visits myself. That meant setting up a Github Pages frontend, an EC2 instance for the backend, buying a domain and pointing it to both Github as well as my backend server, enabling HTTPS on EC2, and so on.

And then if I was doing all that, I might as well turn it into a personal website. So I did. The entire setup taught me a lot so I am going to write about it in detail soon!
