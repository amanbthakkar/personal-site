# Intro

I am a Computer Science grad student at the University of California, Irvine. As of right now, I am actively looking for full-time roles beginning January 2024. If you're a recruiter (!!), please check out my resume and projects and reach out to me @ [thakkaa1@uci.edu](mailto:thakkaa1@uci.edu) or [amanbthakkar@gmail.com](mailto:amanbthakkar@gmail.com).

# Hobbies and Interests

I am an avid football (soccer) fan and absolutely love both playing and watching it. I've also played Fantasy Premier League religiously every year for the past 12 years (minus the last two). I support Chelsea FC and hope to work at the club one day.

During COVID when I was "Working From Home", I got extremely interested in finance, the markets, and cryptocurrencies. I watched Andrew Lo's MIT lectures on the basics of finance and then proceeded to complete a course on Financial Engineering where I learnt more about derivatives and their pricing. And cryptocurrencies + markets = Decentralized Finance! I took part in the first ever DeFi MOOC organized by UC Berkeley and received an Honorary Tier NFT as a certificate for my efforts. I thought of pursuing a Masters in Financial Engineering as well, but ultimately decided to continue Computer Science at UCI.

# Blog Posts

During the above time period I wrote a few blog posts on mathematical models related to pricing of cryptocurrencies, and am particularly fond of one related to the Power Law Oscillator. An entire page on this site is dedicated to it here. I wrote some other posts too, which you can find here.

This website was actually first created out of a desire to not have to run the oscillator Python script daily on my local machine.

I wanted to host it somewhere so I could just look it up daily. I thought I'd share it with everyone, but then I wanted to see how I could keep track of how many people actually visited my website.I could use Google Analytics but I didn't want to.So I decided to create a full-stack website and keep track of the visits myself. That meant setting up a Github pages frontend, an EC2 instance for the backend, buying a domain and pointing it to both Github as well as my backend server, enabling HTTPS on EC2, and so on.

And then if I was doing all that, I might as well turn it into a personal website. So I did. The entire setup taught me a lot so I am going to write about it in detail soon.
